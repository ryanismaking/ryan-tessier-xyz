title: "How do you choose between designs?"
---

Exploring possibilities is a big part of any good designer’s job. Whether you’re creating a landing page for your client or a user flow for your company’s app, you’ll find yourself exploring design choices. Perhaps there are two possible variants of an element or two layouts you’re considering.

Divergent exploration will always lead you to at least a couple of designs. That’s good. Exploration in design is good. However, when the time comes to narrow the possibilities, how do you choose between your designs?

How _do_ you decide which is better? Do you just let the client decide? Ask your boss or your team? Is it based on previous experience? Is it a feeling? A gut instinct?

Your decision-making process, from divergent exploration to convergent decisions—coming up with your solution—is what separates good designers from great ones.

Remember that you are the designer. You’ve been hired to make this decision on behalf of your client or your employer. They believe you are clever enough to help them. So, believe in yourself! You have the skills (or, at least, know how to gain the skills) to methodically analyse a solution and form your **design rationale**.

Design isn’t art. Good design is about systematically solving a problem. A good designer experiments with differences and iterates based on solid reasoning.

Your client or employer expects you to present your solution alongside your design rationale. What are the pros and cons? Why did you settle on _this_ design?

Your design rationale might be based on

- the constraints of the project
- the constraints and conventions of the medium for which you’re designing
- foundational principles and best practices
- your past experience
- an understanding of the people for whom you’re designing

If you have a good grasp of your rationale, you’ll find it easy to choose between designs.

But if none stand out as a clear winner, it might be time to do some more exploration.
